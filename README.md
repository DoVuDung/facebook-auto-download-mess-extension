# Facebook Messenger Extractor

##  LOGIN SUCCESS!

If you're seeing the URL: `https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmessages`

**This is PERFECT and exactly what should happen!** 🎉

### What this means:
-  The script successfully navigated to Facebook
-  Facebook is asking you to log in 
-  After login, it will redirect you to Messenger automatically
-  Everything is working as expected!

### What to do next:
1. 🔐 **Enter your Facebook credentials** (email/username and password)
2. 🛡️ **Complete 2FA** if prompted (authenticator app, SMS, etc.)
3.  **Wait for redirect** - Facebook will take you to Messenger automatically
4. 💬 **Click on your conversation** that you want to extract
5. 👀 **Verify you can see messages** in the chat
6. ⌨️ **Press Ctrl+C** in the terminal to start extraction

### Normal login flow:
```
facebook.com/login.php → [login] → facebook.com/messages → [select chat] → Ready!
```

### Troubleshooting:
- If login fails, refresh the page (Cmd+R) and try again
- Make sure you're using the correct Facebook account
- Complete any security verifications Facebook requests
- Take your time - the script waits indefinitely

**The script is working perfectly! Just complete the login process.** 🚀
