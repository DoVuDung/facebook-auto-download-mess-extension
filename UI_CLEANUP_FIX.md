## âœ… UI Element Cleanup Fix Applied

### **Problem Solved:**
The output was capturing Facebook UI elements and interface text that should be filtered out:
- "SENT", "Enter", "EDITED", "SEND" 
- Date/time stamps mixed with messages
- Interface labels like "You sent", "Delivered", "Seen"

### **Improvements Made:**

#### 1. **Enhanced Text Filtering During Extraction**
```javascript
// Added filters for UI elements:
text !== "Enter" &&
text !== "SENT" &&
text !== "EDITED" &&
text !== "SEND" &&
text !== "Delivered" &&
text !== "Seen" &&
text !== "Read" &&
!text.match(/^(Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)\s+\d{1,2}:\d{2}$/i) &&
!text.match(/^\d{1,2}\s+(JANUARY|FEBRUARY|MARCH|APRIL|MAY|JUNE|JULY|AUGUST|SEPTEMBER|OCTOBER|NOVEMBER|DECEMBER)\s+AT\s+\d{1,2}/i)
```

#### 2. **Improved Content Cleaning**
```javascript
cleanContent = cleanContent
  .replace(/\bSENT\b/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bEnter\b$/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bEDITED\b/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bSEND\b$/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bYou sent\b/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bDelivered\b/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bSeen\b$/gi, "")
  .replace(/\bRead\b$/gi, "")
```

#### 3. **Better Date Detection**
```javascript
// Enhanced patterns to catch more date formats:
/Today|Yesterday|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday|\d{1,2}\s+(JANUARY|FEBRUARY|MARCH|APRIL|MAY|JUNE|JULY|AUGUST|SEPTEMBER|OCTOBER|NOVEMBER|DECEMBER)|Yesterday at \d{1,2}:\d{2}|Today at \d{1,2}:\d{2}/i
```

#### 4. **Mixed Content Separation**
```javascript
// Handles cases where UI elements get mixed with message content
if (cleanContent.includes("You sent") || cleanContent.includes("Enter") || cleanContent.includes("EDITED")) {
  const contentParts = cleanContent.split(/(?:You sent|Enter|EDITED|SENT|Delivered|Seen)/i);
  const actualMessage = contentParts.find(part => /* validate actual message */);
}
```

### **Expected Output Now:**

### **What's Fixed:**
âœ… Removed "SENT", "Enter", "EDITED", "SEND"  
âœ… Cleaned up date/time stamps mixed in messages  
âœ… Filtered out "You sent", "Delivered", "Seen" labels  
âœ… Better separation of dates from message content  
âœ… Preserved actual message content only  

The extraction will now provide clean, readable output with just the actual conversation content! ðŸŽ‰
