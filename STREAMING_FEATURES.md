# 🚀 Facebook Messenger Exporter - Enhanced with Streaming Saves

## 🆕 New Features in v1.0.6

### 📦 **Streaming Save System**
- **Progressive file saving**: Messages are automatically saved in chunks during extraction, not just at the end
- **Real-time backup**: Every 100 messages or 30 seconds, whichever comes first
- **Memory efficient**: Prevents browser crashes on massive conversations (10K+ messages)
- **No data loss**: If extraction stops unexpectedly, you already have partial files saved

### ⚡ **Performance Enhancements for Massive Conversations**
- **10K+ message support**: Optimized specifically for ultra-large conversations
- **Dynamic scroll detection**: Only counts actual scroll attempts, ignoring failed ones
- **Adaptive patience**: Automatically increases wait times and retry attempts for larger conversations
- **Hash-based duplicate detection**: Lightning-fast duplicate checking for massive datasets

### 🎛️ **New Settings**

- **Enhanced UI feedback**: Shows streaming save count and progress in real-time

## 📁 **File Output Options**

### Option 1: Streaming Files (Recommended for Large Conversations)

- Each file contains ~100 messages in chronological order
- Files are saved automatically as extraction progresses
- Perfect for massive conversations to prevent data loss

### Option 2: Single Complete File (Traditional)
- One final consolidated file: `messenger_chat_CONVERSATION_NAME_ALL_MESSAGES.txt`
- Contains all extracted messages in chronological order
- Saved at the end of extraction process
- Best for smaller conversations

### Option 3: Both (Default)
- Get streaming files during extraction PLUS final consolidated file
- Maximum data safety and convenience
- Recommended for all conversation sizes
