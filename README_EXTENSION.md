## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome** 88+ (Manifest V3 support required)
- **Edge** 88+ (Chromium-based)
- **Other Chromium browsers** should work

### Permissions Required
- `activeTab` - Access current tab to read messages
- `scripting` - Inject content script for message extraction
- `downloads` - Save exported files to your computer
- `storage` - Remember your export preferences

### Privacy & Security
-  **No data collection** - Extension doesn't collect or store your personal data
-  **Local processing** - All message extraction happens in your browser
-  **No external servers** - No data sent to third parties
-  **Open source** - All code is visible and auditable

## How It Works

1. **Content Script Injection** - Extension injects code into Messenger pages
2. **DOM Parsing** - Reads message elements from Facebook's HTML structure
3. **Data Extraction** - Extracts sender names, timestamps, and message content
4. **Format Conversion** - Organizes data into readable text format
5. **File Download** - Uses Chrome's download API to save file locally

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
- Make sure you're on a valid Messenger page (`/messages/` or `/t/`)
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check that extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Export Button Disabled?
- Navigate to a specific conversation (not the main messages page)
- Wait for page to fully load before clicking export
- Try scrolling up to load more messages first

### Missing Messages?
- Extension exports currently visible messages
- Scroll up in the conversation to load older messages
- Facebook loads messages dynamically as you scroll

### File Download Issues?
- Check Chrome's download settings and permissions
- Make sure downloads aren't blocked for the site
- Try exporting a smaller number of messages first
